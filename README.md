# CrowdStrike Alert Output Improvement

This repository contains improved output formats for CrowdStrike security alerts, designed to provide clear, actionable, and well-structured incident reports.

## Overview

The improved alert output format addresses common issues with raw CrowdStrike alerts:
- **Better Structure:** Organized sections for quick information retrieval
- **Risk Assessment:** Clear risk evaluation with actionable context
- **Visual Indicators:** Emojis and formatting for quick visual scanning
- **Action Items:** Specific, actionable next steps for responders
- **Comprehensive Context:** Background information to aid decision-making

## Files in This Repository

### 1. `crowdstrike_alert_report.md`
A complete example of the improved alert format, based on a real low-severity PUP/Adware detection.

**Key Features:**
- Executive summary with at-a-glance risk level
- Detailed device and user information
- Comprehensive threat assessment
- VirusTotal integration and analysis
- Risk-based recommendations
- Investigation tracking

### 2. `crowdstrike_alert_template.md`
A reusable template for creating consistent alert reports.

**Usage:** Copy this template and replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` fields with actual alert data.

### 3. `test.md`
Original test file (legacy).

## What's Improved?

### Before (Raw Alert Data)
- Unstructured table format
- Mixed information without clear hierarchy
- No risk assessment or recommendations
- Difficult to scan quickly
- No context for decision-making

### After (Improved Format)
- ✅ **Clear Executive Summary:** Immediate risk understanding
- ✅ **Organized Sections:** Information grouped logically
- ✅ **Risk Assessment:** Likelihood, Impact, and Overall Risk evaluation
- ✅ **Actionable Recommendations:** Specific steps for different scenarios
- ✅ **Visual Indicators:** Quick scanning with emojis and formatting
- ✅ **Context and Background:** Additional information to support decisions
- ✅ **Investigation Tracking:** Status and next steps clearly defined

## Using the Template

1. Copy `crowdstrike_alert_template.md`
2. Replace all fields in `[BRACKETS]` with actual alert values
3. Fill in analysis sections based on your investigation
4. Add any additional context specific to your environment
5. Save with a descriptive filename (e.g., `alert_[ALERT_ID].md`)

## Example Use Case

The included `crowdstrike_alert_report.md` demonstrates how the template handles a low-severity detection:

**Alert:** ZoomInfo Contact Contributor flagged as potential PUP  
**Outcome:** Clear documentation that this is likely a false positive requiring user verification  
**Action:** Simple verification process with clear next steps

## Benefits for Security Teams

1. **Faster Response:** Quick risk assessment enables appropriate prioritization
2. **Better Documentation:** Consistent format improves record-keeping
3. **Knowledge Sharing:** Context helps junior analysts understand detections
4. **Decision Support:** Risk assessment framework guides response actions
5. **Audit Trail:** Investigation notes track response process

## Integration Possibilities

This format can be integrated into:
- SOAR platforms (like Tines)
- Ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow)
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams)
- Documentation repositories
- Incident response workflows

## Customization

Feel free to customize the template for your organization:
- Add company-specific sections
- Modify risk assessment criteria
- Include additional threat intelligence sources
- Adjust action item workflows
- Add compliance or regulatory requirements

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- JSON format for automation
- Automated VirusTotal lookups
- Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- Automated risk scoring
- Response playbook automation
- Metrics and reporting dashboards
